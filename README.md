## Week 6 Assignment - Ryan Hull

This repo contains a simple ndoe express application that will call an AWS lambda function with a word, and return "Ryan says: [word]". The .env.example shows the secret/key that is needed to call the lambda function.

The lambda function in this repo is a copy of what is hosted on AWS.
